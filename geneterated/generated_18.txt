 In a statement released Tuesday, Universal Pictures said that it was "pleased with the outcome" of its legal battle against Sony Pictures.

 The lawsuit filed Tuesday seeks unspecified damages from Universal, which has been accused of illegally distributing copies of the film. 
 
 The suit also names Sony, which produced the film, as well as two other companies -- 20th Century Fox Film Corporation and New Line Cinema -- that have distributed it. 
 
 The case stems from a dispute between Sony Pictures, which owns the rights to the book, and Warner Bros., which holds distribution rights.

 But the judge dismissed those claims earlier this year.

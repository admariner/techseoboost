Links Narend Ramodi says "Will be campaigning in Maharashtra tomorrow. Looking forward to addressing rallies in Jalgaon and Sakoli. The NDA is going to the people based on the stellar work of our Government led by the youthful and visionary CM Devendra Fadnavis Ji. We seek five more years to serve the state." 
 
 In a statement released after his meeting with Modi, Fadnavis, who was elected chief minister last year, said he had "appreciated Prime Minister Narendra Modiâ€™s vision for India as well as his commitment towards strengthening democracy at all levels." 
 
 He also thanked Modi "for taking up issues that are important to us like education, health care, rural development, environment and other social issues." 
 
 "I am confident that we will continue working together to build an inclusive society where everyone has equal opportunities and access to power," Fadnavis said. 
 
 BJP leaders have been trying hard to convince voters not only about their economic policies but also about what they see as the party's core values -- secularism, nationalism and anti-corruption. 
 
 But many analysts say these efforts may backfire if the party fails to win over enough votes from India's large population of Muslims or its Hindu majority. 
 
 "The BJP's campaign strategy seems to focus too much on wooing Muslim voters," said political analyst Sanjay Kishore.

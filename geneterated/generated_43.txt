Links Tyalor Swift says "Had the best time playing Lover on Saturday Night Live exactly the way I wrote it, on piano in a quiet moment. A huge thank you to Lenny Pickett for playing on False God ! Phoebe was excellent as host &amp; Mary Ellen Matthews is always awesome to work with. Make sure to watch Camila next week! "

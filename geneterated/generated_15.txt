Links Jimmy Fallon says "There's nothing better than vacation reading. ThisIsBaby PuertoRico " 
 
 The book is a collection of short stories about the island and its people. 
 
 "I think it's important to have books that are not just for Puerto Ricans, but also for people who don't know much about this place," said Fallon. 
 
 He added that he hopes his new book, which will be published in October, can help bring more attention to the island. 
 
 "It's an amazing place with incredible people, so I hope it helps raise awareness around it," he said. 
 
 In addition to being on vacation, Fallon has been working as a correspondent for NBC News since last year. 
 
 His first assignment was covering Hurricane Maria when it hit Puerto Rico. 
 
 Since then, he's covered everything from hurricanes to earthquakes to natural disasters. 
 
 "I'm really excited to get back into hurricane coverage," he said.â€‹

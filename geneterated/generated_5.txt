 Grande, who is currently touring behind her new album, has been open about how she struggled to get through some tough times while growing up. 
 
 In one interview from 2014, she said that when she was younger, "I had no idea what love was. I thought you were supposed to be able to fall in love."

 On Friday, Grande shared a photo of herself holding up two bottles of champagne. 
 
 "Love & Champagne For The First Time #LoveAndChampagne," she wrote.

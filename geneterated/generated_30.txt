Links Selena Gomez says "I had the honor of sitting down with some of the young adults from Living Undocumented where we had a genuine conversation about the immigration issue and their lives. It was honest and heartbreaking. I would love for you guys to check it out. " 
 
 The singer also shared her thoughts on how she feels about being called an "illegal immigrant." 
 
 "I'm not going to let that define me. I'm just trying to be who I am as an artist and that's what I've always been about. And it's really important because people are so quick to judge me or say things like that. It's such a big thing in this country right now but at the same time we're all immigrants. We have different backgrounds and upbringings and experiences and everything else. So why can't we talk about it? Why do we need to keep talking about it?" 
 
 She continued, "It's something that is very personal to me, especially when you're undocumented. You don't want your story to get lost in the shuffle and forgotten about." 
 
 In addition to performing live during the show, Gomez will perform two songs off of her upcoming album Selena:

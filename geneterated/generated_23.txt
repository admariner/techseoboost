 The only thing that is worse than the fact that this show has been cancelled is how it was cancelled. 
 
 I don't know what happened with the show, but it's a shame because they had such potential. 
 
 This show could be so much better and more interesting without all these pop culture references. 
 
 I'm not sure why people are complaining about this. It's an amazing show. 
 
 If you want something like this, go watch some reality TV. 
 
 And for those who say its too similar to other shows, well that's exactly what makes it unique. 
 
 It doesn't try to copy anything else out there. 
 
 Its original premise is unique in itself. 
 
 So many shows on TV today follow the same formula as Glee, which isn't necessarily bad, but there really aren't enough new ideas coming out. 
 
 But Glee does have one major advantage over most shows: 
 
 They actually care about their characters. 
 
 You can tell by watching them interact with each other. 
 
 There is no "filler" or filler episodes. 
 
 All of the characters are developed well. 
 
 Their chemistry together is amazing.

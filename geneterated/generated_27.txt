Links Donald Trump says "So now they are after the legendary "crime buster" and greatest Mayor in the history of NYC, Rudy Giuliani. He may seem a little rough around the edges sometimes, but he is also a great guy and wonderful lawyer. Such a one sided Witch Hunt going on in USA. Deep State. Shameful!" 
 
 Giuliani said that if there was any evidence to back up Trump's claim about wiretapping, it would be released by now. 
 
 "If there's no evidence, then we don't have an investigation," Giuliani said. 
 
 The former New York City mayor added that his conversations with Mueller were "very productive" and that he had been impressed with Mueller's team so far. 
 
 "I think he's doing a very good job," Giuliani said, adding that he has not spoken directly with Trump. 
 
 But Giuliani did say that he believes the president will ultimately come around. 
 
 "He wants to do this because it's what he thinks is right for our country," Giuliani told CNN. 
 
 Giuliani said he expects Trump to make a decision soon. 
 
 "The President needs to decide whether or not he'll continue down this path or not," Giuliani said.â€‹
